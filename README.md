# Transfer Learning for Audio Classification

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates transfer learning for audio classification using the YAMNet model. The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Installation**: Installs necessary packages like TensorFlow, TensorFlow IO, and Google authentication.
2. **Loading YAMNet Model**: Loads the pre-trained YAMNet model from TensorFlow Hub.
3. **Loading Test Audio**: Downloads a sample audio file and preprocesses it for inference.
4. **Inference**: Runs inference on the preprocessed audio using the YAMNet model to classify the audio into different classes.
5. **Result**: Prints the inferred class and the shape of the embeddings generated by the model.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install the required packages mentioned in the notebook.
3. Execute each cell sequentially.
